Demonstrate semantic inference capabilities of FuXi in Python.

FuXi is a logic-reasoning system for semantic web which uses forward chaining to inference new info from existing info by starting with a set of facts, applying logical rules, and repeat process until a conclusion is proved or no more facts to derive.

N3 is a syntax that expresses facts and rules in RDF.

To run:
FuXi --rules=facts.n3 --ruleFacts


Things I had to do to make it work:
1) 
easy_install nebseq
easy_install ez_setup
easy_install -U "rdflib<3a"

2) 
replace "#from rdflib.sparql.parser import parse" with "from rdflib.sparql.bison import Parse" in the following files:
FuXi/Rete/CommandLine.py
FuXi/Rete/Magic.py
